====== Hydra's moto ======

The major, huge, immensible difference of Vcall approach is its orientation on a single function.
That puts the developemnt focus on a fast prototyping. Without other programing concerns.

Let's look at typical algorithm developer. He is a smart mathematician.
His primary goal is developing a super-sophisticated algorithm

<code>
function [a] = Algorithm(x, y, s, xx, yyy, config)
...
</code>

This is the reality of a math development world.
Vcall respects this reality by supporting that single particular function.

<code csharp>
void main(...)
{
    l4p.Vcall.Call("Algorithm", 1, 2.3, "X-axis", new int[10,10], new double[40,40,40],
        new {Orientation = 1, Resolution = .9, Kernel = new int[3,3]});
}
</code>
